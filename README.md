# Image-Captioning-Project
This project utilizes deep learning techniques to automatically generate descriptive captions for images. It also contains a self-hosted web server through Flask for users to upload their own images.

## Features

- Automatically generates captions for uploaded images.
- Uses a pretrained deep learning model to understand image content.
- Provides a seamless integration of computer vision and natural language processing.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
